Here you can see the full commit history of these 2 folders, the client and server side of my project "Quick-Bite", in full.

There's a bunch of test restaurants in the cities of London and Manchester, which can be used to create orders. You can create your own restaurant, set up your own menu and profile banner. You can submit orders, which would show up on your order status page. Orders from your own restaurant will appear in the manage restaurant tab, where you can updaate the status of your own restaurant.

This was created with Typescript, React, React-Router, Express, MongoDB, Stripe, ShadCn, and more!

I hope you enjoy :)
